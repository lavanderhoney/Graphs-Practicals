# Graphs-Practicals

A collection of practical implementations of graph algorithms in Python. This project is designed for learning, experimenting, and demonstrating various graph-related algorithms and techniques.\
These implementations are part of the Graph Theory course 3CS515ME24 at Nirma Univeristy. 

## Overview

This repository includes implementations of the following graph algorithms and operations:

- **Chromatic Number Calculation**  
  Implementation for determining the chromatic number of a graph (see `chromatic_number.py`).

- **Graph Cut Sets**
  - `cut_sets_a.py`: An algorithm for finding graph cut sets (variant A).
  - `cut_sets_karger.py`: A probabilistic algorithm for finding minimum cut sets using Kargerâ€™s algorithm.

- **Graph Base & Operations**
  - `graph_base.py`: A foundational module for graph representations and basic operations.
  - `graph_ops.py`: Additional operations and utilities for processing graphs.
  
- **Graph Realization**
  - `graph_havel_hakimi.py`: Implements the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to determine whether a given degree sequence is graphical.

- **Graph Isomorphism**
  - `graph_isomorphism.py`: Methods to test if two graphs are isomorphic.

- **Clique Finding**
  - `maximum_clique.py`: Algorithms to detect the maximum clique in a graph.

- **Maze Solver**
  - `maze_solver.py`: Implements pathfinding techniques to solve maze problems.

- **Planarity Testing**
  - `planarity.py`: Checks for planarity of a graph.

- **Prufer Code Generation**
  - `prufer_code.py`: Generates and interprets Prufer codes for trees.

- **Graph Reconstruction**
  - `reconstruct itenary.py`: Reconstructs graphs based on provided itineraries or sequences.

- **Minimum Spanning Tree**
  - `spanning_tree.py`: Implements algorithms to compute a minimum spanning tree for a graph.

This repository is entirely written in Python and demonstrates practical applications of algorithm design within the realm of graph theory.
